### Prologue
As an engineer in a tech company, you sit for a talk from the leadership. After the customary praise and motivation to the team saying the team is awesome and we need to push further, the leadership puts together a set of principles that would define the direction of engineering. An example of would at a very high level would be the famous quote of **Move fast and break things** . As engineers scratch their heads with **break things quote** this becomes viral and every other company wants to **Move fast and break things**

### Technology leadership
As a tech leader from the lead of the team to an architect to an org. The first rule is never to copy other company's principles in whatever form. First, it would sound cringe and un-original but there are deeper problems of adopting other companies' principles. The context for **Move Fast and Break Things** may apply to startup although **break things** does not apply to any type of org. It's not fun when u **Break Things** and sit with an angry customer who is baying for your blood. But this context may not apply to a place where you are writing mission-critical software where cost of moving fast and breaking things may be too high probably even lives

### How to form the principles in the first place

As a tech leader before forming high-level principles, the tech leader has to stand in the trenches with engineers, customer support, and sales and have a deep understanding of issues. 

An example of when the tech lead of the Java Language came up with his principle for how the Java language to move forward he came with the statement **Move Deliberately and Don't Break Things**. This may sound like a cringe reply but it has deeper meaning. Java as a language supports thousands of mission-critical software and every release of the Java language version should support an old dusty jar written in the early 2000s and it is expected to run faster than the older version of Java.

So Java does not need a hip engineer creating the latest cool language feature and probably breaking backward compatibly and putting forward a huge support burden in the future to support the new shiny feature. Java language features need huge deliberation before something is put out and a long support for it. 


### Principle worth enough to copy
The erstwhile CEO of SUN Scot McNealy set the principle of SUN as **Kick But Have fun Dont cheat customers**. Well, that resulted in some of the greatest innovations like Solaris zones( precursor to docker) , the networking stack, the Java language, etc. Again I may sound like a fanboy but the idea is leadership principles should be grounded in the reality of the product that the company builds, deep thought about the customers who are using the product, and the smart engineer, support, and sales who stand in  the trenches build and supports the product
